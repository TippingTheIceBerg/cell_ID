    <p>Welcome,this page was created while I was working as a MLS at a hospital. I felt at many times that if I was able to study at home the material I learned at work, work would be much more easier. So,I took initivate and made this website where I would both improve myself at my current work while also focusing on the future where I would want to be a Web developer.</p>
