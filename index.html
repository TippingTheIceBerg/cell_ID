<h2 id="Neutrophils">Neutrophils</h2>
<p >Neutrophils are so named because they are not well stained by either eosin, a red acidic stain, nor by methylene blue, a
basic or alkaline stain. Neutrophils, are also known as "segs", "PMNs" or "polys" (polymorphonuclears). They are the
body's primary defense against bacterial infection and physiologic stress. Normally, most of the neutrophils circulating
in the bloodstream are in a mature form, with the nucleus of the cell being divided or segmented. Because of the
segmented appearance of the nucleus, neutrophils are sometimes referred to as "segs." The nucleus of less mature
neutrophils is not segmented, but has a band or rod-like shape. Less mature neutrophils - those that have recently been
released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream - are known as "bands" or "stabs". Stab is a German term for rod.</p>

<h2 id="Lymphocytes">Lymphocytes</h2>
<p >The round, uniform nucleus and small amount of cytoplasm surrounding it are the best identifying characteristics for
this cell. Lymphocytes are involved in the specific immune response including antigen-antibody reactions.

<h2 id="Basophils" >Basophils</h2>
<p>Basophils are intermediate in size between neutrophils and eosinophils and have simple or bilobed nuclei. They contain
many coarse purple granules that can vary in size or shape.</p>

<div class="clearfix">
<h2 id="Eosinophils" >Eosinophils</h2>
<p>These cells are 12 - 17 Âµm in diameter - larger than neutrophils, and about 3 times the size of a red blood cell. You
can see that eosinophils only have two lobes to their nucleus. These cells have large acidophilic specific granules -
these stain bright red, or reddish-purple.</p>

<h2 id="Monocytes" >Monocytes</h2>
<p>Monocytes are spherical in shape or may appear amoeboid. They are large in size and have a large nucleus
that is usually bean shaped. This characteristic differentiates monocytes from neutrophils, which have several lobes
with a divided nucleus. In tissues, monocytes transform to macrophages. </p>
